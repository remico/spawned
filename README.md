# spawned
A simple python module for dealing with sub-processes. Based on [pexpect](https://github.com/pexpect/pexpect).

###### Note 
Linux only, since it relies on `bash`, `rm` and `sudo` commands and might use specific *bash* syntax internally. 

##### Requirements
- python >= 3.8
- latest `pexpect` version
